# 🖧 LAN Network with Routing (Packet Tracer Project)

This project is a basic LAN network simulation created in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It demonstrates the use of routers, switches, and end devices to build a functioning network with routing.

## 📁 Files
- **network_simulation.pkt** — The main Packet Tracer simulation file.
- **README.md** — This file.

## 📝 Setup Instructions
1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Download and install from [NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) if you don't have it.

2. **Open the Simulation**
   - Open `network_simulation.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Review the Network Topology**
   - The network includes:
     - Routers with static/dynamic routing.
     - Switches connecting LAN segments.
     - End devices (PCs/Servers).

4. **Test the Network**
   - Verify connectivity between devices (e.g., by using `ping`).
   - Check routing tables on routers (`show ip route`).

5. **Modify or Extend**
   - You can expand the network by adding more routers, switches, or end devices.

## 🖥️ How to Use
- **Open** the `.pkt` file.
- **Run simulations** to observe packet flow.
- **Experiment** with different configurations.
